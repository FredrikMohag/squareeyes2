## Cross-course project

### Description:

For this assignment, I chose to develop a captivating movie website called "Square Eyes." It's a virtual hub where movie enthusiasts can dive into the world of cinema. Throughout my first year, I dedicated time and effort to refining this project, using a mix of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, APIs, and WordPress. My goal was to create an engaging platform that not only demonstrates my technical abilities but also reflects my love for movies.
